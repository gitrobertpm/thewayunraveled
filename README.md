The primary purpose of this site is to make the user feel good, to put a smile on the user's face.  It's an attempt to create a web experience that is impossible not to enjoy.  It's meant to leave you feeling better after your visit than you felt before you stopped by.

It's difficult to say if that lofty goal was thoroughly achieved, but I feel pretty good about the results of this early attempt.

The secondary purpose is to demonstrate to potential employers just what I have learned and what I can do.  If this is you, my personal information can be found on the about page.

Check out the globe at the bottom of the mission statement. :)
